<p>America is sometimes offered to us, even by Americans (who ought to 
know better), as a moral example. There are indeed very real American 
virtues; but this virtuous attitude is hardly one of them. And if anyone 
wants to know what a welter of weakness and inconsequence the moral mind of 
America can sometimes be, he may be advised to look, not so much to the Crime 
Wage or the Charleston, as to the serious idealistic essays by highbrows and 
cultural critics, such as one by Miss Avis D. Carlson on 'Wanted: A 
Substitute for Righteousness.' By righteousness she means, of course, the 
narrow New England taboos; but she does not know it. For the inference she 
draws is that we should recognize frankly that 'the standard abstract right 
and wrong is moribund.' This statement will seem less insane if we consider, 
somewhat curiously, what the standard abstract right and wrong seems to mean 
-- at least in her section of the States. It is a glimpse of an incredible world.
<p>
She takes the case of a young man brought up 'in a home where there was an 
attempt to make dogmatic cleavage of right and wrong.' And what was the 
dogmatic cleavage? Ah, what indeed! His elders told him that some things were 
right and some wrong; and for some time he accepted this strange assertion. 
But when he leaves home he finds that, 'apparently perfectly nice people do 
the things he has been taught to think evil.' Then follows a revelation. 'The 
flowerlike girl he envelops in a mist of romantic idealization smokes like an 
imp from the lower regions and pets like a movie vamp. The chum his heart 
yearns towards cultivates a hip-flask, etc.' And this is what the writer 
calls a dogmatic cleavage between right and wrong!
<p>
The standard of abstract right and wrong apparently is this. That a girl by 
smoking a cigarette makes herself one of the company of the fiends of hell. 
That such an action is much the same as that of a sexual vampire. That a 
young man who continues to drink fermented liquor must necessarily be 'evil' 
and must deny the very existence of any difference between right and wrong. 
That is the 'standard of abstract right and wrong' that is apparently taught 
in the American home. And it is perfectly obvious, on the face of it, that it 
is not a standard of abstract right or wrong at all. That is exactly what it 
is not. That is the very last thing any clear-headed person would call it. It 
is not a standard; it is not abstract; it has not the vaguest notion of what 
is meant by right and wrong. It is a chaos of social and sentimental 
accidents and associations, some of them snobbish, all of them provincial, 
but, above all, nearly all of them concrete and connected with a 
materialistic prejudice against particular materials.  To have a horror of 
tobacco is not to have an abstract standard of right; but exactly the 
opposite. It is to have no standard of right whatever; and to make certain 
local likes and dislikes as a substitute. We need not be very surprised if 
the young man repudiates these meaningless vetoes as soon as he can; but if 
he thinks he is repudiating morality, he must be almost as muddle-headed as 
his father. And yet the writer in question calmly proposes that we should 
abolish all ideas of right and wrong, and abandon the whole human conception 
of a standard of abstract justice, because a boy in Boston cannot be induced 
to think that a nice girl is a devil when she smokes a cigarette.
<p>
If the rising generation were faced with no worse doubts and difficulties 
than this, it would not be very difficult to reconcile them to the traditions 
of truth and justice. But I think the episode is worth mentioning, merely 
because it throws a ray of light on the moral condition of American Culture, 
in the decay of Puritanism. And when next we are told that the idealism of 
America is to set a 'standard' by which England must transform herself, it 
will be well to remember what is apparently meant by a standard and an ideal; 
and that the fire of idealism seems both to begin and end in smoke.
<p>
Incidentally, I must say I can bear witness to this queer taboo about 
tobacco. Of course numberless Americans smoke numberless cigars; a great many 
others eat cigars, which seems to me a more occult pleasure. But there does 
exist an extraordinary idea that ethics are involved in some way; and many 
who smoke really disapprove of smoking. I remember once receiving two 
American interviewers on the same afternoon; there was a box of cigars in 
front of me and I offered one to each in turn. Their reaction (as they would 
probably call it) was very curious to watch. The first journalist stiffened 
suddenly and silently and declined in a very cold voice. He could not have 
conveyed more plainly that I had attempted to corrupt an honorable man with a 
foul and infamous indulgence; as if I were the Old Man of the Mountain 
offering him hashish that would turn him into an assassin. The second 
reaction was even more remarkable. The second journalist first looked 
doubtful; then looked sly; then seemed to glance about him nervously, as if 
wondering whether we were alone, and then said with a sort of crestfallen and 
covert smile: 'Well, Mr. Chesterton, I'm afraid I have the habit.'
<p>
As I also have the habit, and have never been able to imagine how it could be 
connected with morality or immorality, I confess that I plunged with him 
deeply into an immoral life. In the course of our conversation, I found he 
was otherwise perfectly sane. He was quite intelligent about economics or 
architecture; but his moral sense seemed to have entirely disappeared. He 
really thought it rather wicked to smoke. He had no 'standard of abstract 
right or wrong'; in him it was not merely moribund; it was apparently dead. 
But anyhow, that is the point and that is the test. Nobody who has an 
abstract standard of right and wrong can possibly think it wrong to smoke a 
cigar. But he had a concrete standard of particular cut and dried customs of 
a particular tribe. Those who say Americans are largely descended from the 
American Indians might certainly make a case out of the suggestion that this 
mystical horror of material things is largely a barbaric sentiment. The Red 
Indian is said to have tried and condemned a tomahawk for committing a 
murder. In this case he was certainly the prototype of the white man who 
curses a bottle because too much of it goes into a man. Prohibition is 
sometimes praised for its simplicity; on these lines it may be equally 
condemned for its savagery. But I myself do not say anything so absurd as 
that Americans are savages; nor do I think it would matter much if they were 
descended from savages. It is culture that counts and not ethnology; and the 
culture that is concerned here derives indirectly rather from New England 
than from Old America. Whatever it derives from, however, this is the thing 
to be noted about it: that it really does not seem to understand what is 
meant by a standard of right and wrong. It is a vague sentimental notion that 
certain habits were not suitable to the old log cabin or the old hometown. It 
has a vague utilitarian notion that certain habits are not directly useful in 
the new amalgamated stores or the new financial gambling-hell. If his aged 
mother or his economic master dislikes to see a young man hanging about with 
a pipe in his mouth, the action becomes a sin; or the nearest that such a 
moral philosophy can come to the idea of a sin. A man does not chop wood for 
the log hut by smoking; and a man does not make dividends for the Big Boss by 
smoking; and therefore smoking has a smell as of something sinful. Of what 
the great theologians and moral philosophers have meant by a sin, these 
people have no more idea than a child drinking milk has of a great 
toxicologist analyzing poisons. It may be a credit of their virtue to be thus 
vague about vice. The man who is silly enough to say, when offered a 
cigarette, 'I have no vices,' may not always deserve the rapier-thrust of the 
reply given by the Italian Cardinal, 'It is not a vice, or doubtless you 
would have it.' But at least the Cardinal knows it is not a vice; which 
assists the clarity of his mind. But the lack of clear standards among those 
who vaguely think of it as a vice may yet be the beginning of much peril and 
oppression. My two American journalists, between them, may yet succeed in 
adding the sinfulness of cigars to the other curious things now part of the 
American Constitution.
<p>
I would therefore venture to say to Miss Avis Carlson that the quarrel in 
question does not arise from the Yankee Puritans having too much morality, 
but from their having too little. It does not arise from their drawing too 
hard and fast a line of distinction between right and wrong, but from their 
being much to loose and indistinct. They go by associations and not by 
abstractions. Therefore they classify smoking with vamping or a flask in the 
pocket with sin in the soul. I hope at least that some of the Fundamentalists 
will succeed in being a little more fundamental than this. The men of 
Tennessee are supposed to be very anxious to draw the line between men and 
monkeys. They are also supposed by some to be rather too anxious to draw the 
line between black men and white men. May I be allowed to hope that they will 
succeed in drawing a rather more logical line between bad men and good men? 
Something of the the difference and the difficulty may be seen by comparing 
the old Ku Klux Klan with the new Klu Klux Klan. The old secret society may 
have been justified or not; but it had a definite object: it was directed 
against somebody. The new secret society seems to have been directed against 
anybody; often against anybody who drank; in time, for all I know, against 
anybody who smoked. It is this sort of formless fanaticism that is the great 
danger of the American Temperament; and it is well to insist that if men must 
persecute, they will be more clear-headed if they persecute for a creed.
