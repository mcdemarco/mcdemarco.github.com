<hr><p>
You can only find truth with logic if you have already found truth without it.
</p><hr /><p>
I am incurably convinced that the object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.
</p><hr /><p>
<!-- The same slander on democracy can be noticed in the case of -->
<!-- advertisements. --> There is many a tender old Tory imagination
that vaguely feels that our streets would be hung with escutcheons and
tapestries, if only the profane vulgar had not hung them with
advertisements of Sapolio and Sunlight Soap.  But advertisement does
not come from the unlettered many.  It comes from the refined few.
Did you ever hear of a mob rising to placard the Town Hall with
proclamations in favor of Sapolio?  Did you ever see a poor, ragged
man laboriously drawing and painting a picture on the wall in favour
of Sunlight Soap - simply as a labour of love?  It is nonsense; those
who hang our public walls with ugly pictures are the same select few
who hang their private walls with exquisite and expensive pictures.
The vulgarization of life has come from the governing class; from the
highly educated class. 
</p><hr /><p>
I'm still a liberal. It's those people who aren't liberals.
</p><hr /><p>
Comforts that were rare among our forefathers are now multiplied in
factories and handed out wholesale; and indeed, nobody nowadays, so
long as he is content to go without air, space, quiet, decency and
good manners, need be without anything whatever that he wants; or at
least a reasonably cheap imitation of it. 
</p><hr /><p>
My attitude toward progress has passed from antagonism to boredom. I
have long ceased to argue with people who prefer Thursday to Wednesday
because it is Thursday. 
</p><hr /><p>
When such a critic says, for instance, that faith kept the world in
darkness until doubt led to enlightenment, he is himself taking things
on faith, things that he has never been sufficiently enlightened to
doubt. That exceedingly crude simplification of human history is what
he has been taught, and he believes it because he has been taught. I
do not blame him for that; I merely remark that he is an unconscious
example of everything that he reviles.
</p><hr /><p>
The act of defending any of the cardinal virtues has today all the
exhilaration of a vice. 
</p><hr /><p>
It is the beginning of all true criticism of our time to realize that
it has really nothing to say, at the very moment when it has invented
so tremendous a trumpet for saying it.
</p><hr /><p>
When men have come to the edge of a precipice, it is the lover of life 
who has the spirit to leap backwards, and only the pessimist who 
continues to believe in progress.
</p><hr /><p>
What is education? Properly speaking, there is no such thing as
education. Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from
one generation to another. ... What we need is to have a culture before
we hand it down. In other words, it is a truth, however sad and
strange, that we cannot give what we have not got, and cannot teach to
other people what we do not know ourselves.
</p><hr /><p>
The purpose of Compulsory Education is to deprive the common people of
their commonsense. 
</p><hr /><p>
Many clever men like you have trusted to civilisation.  Many clever 
Babylonians, many clever Egyptians, many clever men at the end of Rome.  
Can you tell me, in a world that is flagrant with the failures of 
civilisation, what there is particularly immortal about yours?
</p><hr /><p>
The madman is not the man who has lost his reason.  The madman is the man 
who has lost everything except his reason.
</p><hr /><p>
Did Herbert Spencer ever convince you - did he ever convince anybody - did 
he ever for one mad moment convince himself - that it must be to the 
interest of the individual to feel a public spirit? ... Herbert Spencer 
refrained from theft for the same reason that he refrained from wearing 
feathers in his hair, because he was an English gentleman with different 
tastes. 
</p><hr /><p>
Every man has hated mankind when he was less than a man.
</p><hr /><p>
It isn't that they can't see the solution.  It is that they can't see
the problem. 
</p><hr /><p>
We have remarked that one reason offered for being a progressive is
that things naturally tend to grow better. But the only real reason
for being a progressive is that things naturally tend to grow
worse. The corruption in things is not only the best argument for
being progressive; it is also the only argument against being
conservative. The conservative theory would really be quite sweeping
and unanswerable if it were not for this one fact. But all
conservatism is based upon the idea that if you leave things alone you
leave them as they are. But you do not. If you leave a thing alone you
leave it to a torrent of change. If you leave a white post alone it
will soon be a black post. If you particularly want it to be white you
must be always painting it again; that is, you must be always having a
revolution. Briefly, if you want the old white post you must have a
new white post.
</p><hr /><p>
A dead thing can go with the stream, but only a living thing can go
against it.
</p><hr /><p>
Men will ask what selfish sort of woman it must have been who ruthlessly 
exacted tribute in the form of flowers, or what an avaricious creature 
she can have been to demand solid gold in the form of a ring; just as they 
ask what cruel kind of God can have demanded sacrifice and self-denial.
</p><hr /><p>
Is one religion as good as another? Is one horse in the Derby as good as another?
</p><hr /><p>
Posting a letter and getting married [sic] are among the few things left 
that are entirely romantic; for to be entirely romantic, a thing must be 
irrevocable.
</p><hr /><p>
To be in a romance is to be in uncongenial surroundings.
</p><hr /><p>
It is of the new things that men tire - of fashions and proposals and 
improvements and change.  It is the old things that startle and 
intoxicate.  It is the old things that are young.
</p><hr /><p>
If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.
</p><hr /><p>
...[T]here are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity.  When you say 
'thank you' for the salt, do you mean what you say?  No.  When you say 
'the world is round,' do you mean what you say? No.  It is true, but you 
don't mean it.
</p><hr /><p>
Art, like morality, consists in drawing a line somewhere.
</p><hr /><p>
Rossetti make the remark somewhere, bitterly but with great truth, that the
worst moment for the atheist is when he is really thankful and has nobody 
to thank.
</p><hr /><p>
<a href="wine.html">Omar Khayyam's wine-bibbing</a> is bad, not
because it is wine-bibbing. It is bad, and very bad, because it is
medical wine-bibbing.  It is the drinking of a man who drinks because
he is not happy. [...]  He feasts because life is not joyful; he
revels because he is not glad.
</p><hr /><p>
To have a horror of tobacco is not to have an abstract standard of right; 
but exactly the opposite. It is to have no standard of right whatever; 
and to make certain local likes and dislikes as a substitute.
</p><hr /><p>
To each man one soul only is
given; to each soul only is given a little power - the power at some
moments to outgrow and swallow up the stars.  If age after age that power
comes upon men, whatever gives it to them is great.  Whatever makes men
feel old is mean - an empire or a skin-flint shop.  Whatever makes men
feel young is great - a great war or a love story.
</p><hr /><p>
For it is a sin against the reason to tell men that to travel hopefully 
is better than to arrive; and when once they believe it, they travel 
hopefully no longer.
</p><hr /><p>
So far as a man may be proud of a religion rooted in humility, I am
very proud of my religion; I am especially proud of those parts of it
that are most commonly called superstition. I am proud of being
fettered by antiquated dogmas and enslaved by dead creeds (as my
journalistic friends repeat with so much pertinacity), for I know very
well that it is the heretical creeds that are dead, and that it is
only the reasonable dogma that lives long enough to be called
antiquated.
</p><hr /><p>
The public does not like bad literature. The public likes a certain
kind of literature and likes that kind of literature even when it is
bad better than another kind of literature even when it is good. Nor
is this unreasonable; for the line between different types of
literature is as real as the line between tears and laughter; and to
tell people who can only get bad comedy that you have some first-class
tragedy is as irrational as to offer a man who is shivering over weak
warm coffee a really superior sort of ice. <cite>--<a

<!-- [St. Francis of Assisi] was the very contrary of that sort of oriental
visionary who is only a mystic because he is too much of a sceptic to
be a materialist. -->
