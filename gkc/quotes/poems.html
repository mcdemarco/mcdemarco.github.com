<h2>Lepanto</h2>
<p>
<dd>White founts falling in the Courts of the sun,
<dd>And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;
<dd>There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,
<dd>It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard;
<dd>It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips;
<dd>For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.
<dd>They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy,
<dd>They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,
<dd>And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,
<dd>And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross.
<dd>The cold queen of England is looking in the glass;
<dd>The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;
<dd>From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun,
<dd>And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun.
<p>
<dd>Dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard,
<dd>Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred,
<dd>Where, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall,
<dd>The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall,
<dd>The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung,
<dd>That once went singing southward when all the world was young.
<dd>In that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid,
<dd>Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade.
<dd>Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far,
<dd>Don John of Austria is going to the war,
<dd>Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold
<dd>In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold,
<dd>Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,
<dd>Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes.
<dd>Don John laughing in the brave beard curled,
<dd>Spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world,
<dd>Holding his head up for a flag of all the free.
<dd>Love-light of Spain--hurrah!
<dd>Death-light of Africa!
<dd>Don John of Austria
<dd>Is riding to the sea.
<p>
<dd>Mahound is in his paradise above the evening star,
<dd><i>(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)</i>
<dd>He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri's knees,
<dd>His turban that is woven of the sunsets and the seas.
<dd>He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease,
<dd>And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees;
<dd>And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring
<dd>Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing.
<dd>Giants and the Genii,
<dd>Multiplex of wing and eye,
<dd>Whose strong obedience broke the sky
<dd>When Solomon was king.
<p>
<dd>They rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn,
<dd>From the temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn;
<dd>They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea
<dd>Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be,
<dd>On them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl,
<dd>Splashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl;
<dd>They swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground,--
<dd>They gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound.
<dd>And he saith, "Break up the mountains where the hermit-folk can hide,
<dd>And sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide,
<dd>And chase the Giaours flying night and day, not giving rest,
<dd>For that which was our trouble comes again out of the west.
<dd>We have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun,
<dd>Of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done.
<dd>But a noise is in the mountains, in the mountains, and I know
<dd>The voice that shook our palaces--four hundred years ago:
<dd>It is he that saith not 'Kismet'; it is he that knows not Fate;
<dd>It is Richard, it is Raymond, it is Godfrey at the gate!
<dd>It is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth,
<dd>Put down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth."
<dd>For he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar,
<dd><i>(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)</i>
<dd>Sudden and still--hurrah!
<dd>Bolt from Iberia!
<dd>Don John of Austria
<dd>Is gone by Alcalar.
<p>
<dd>St. Michaels on his Mountain in the sea-roads of the north
<dd><i>(Don John of Austria is girt and going forth.)</i>
<dd>Where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift
<dd>And the sea-folk labour and the red sails lift.
<dd>He shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone;
<dd>The noise is gone through Normandy; the noise is gone alone;
<dd>The North is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes,
<dd>And dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise,
<dd>And Christian killeth Christian in a narrow dusty room,
<dd>And Christian dreadeth Christ that hath a newer face of doom,
<dd>And Christian hateth Mary that God kissed in Galilee,--
<dd>But Don John of Austria is riding to the sea.
<dd>Don John calling through the blast and the eclipse
<dd>Crying with the trumpet, with the trumpet of his lips,
<dd>Trumpet that sayeth <i>ha!
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domino gloria!</i>
<dd>Don John of Austria
<dd>Is shouting to the ships.
<p>
<dd>King Philip's in his closet with the Fleece about his neck
<dd><i>(Don John of Austria is armed upon the deck.)</i>
<dd>The walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin,
<dd>And little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in.
<dd>He holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon,
<dd>He touches, and it tingles, and he trembles very soon,
<dd>And his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey
<dd>Like plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day,
<dd>And death is in the phial and the end of noble work,
<dd>But Don John of Austria has fired upon the Turk.
<dd>Don John's hunting, and his hounds have bayed--
<dd>Booms away past Italy the rumour of his raid.
<dd>Gun upon gun, ha! ha!
<dd>Gun upon gun, hurrah!
<dd>Don John of Austria
<dd>Has loosed the cannonade.
<p>
<dd>The Pope was in his chapel before day or battle broke,
<dd><i>(Don John of Austria is hidden in the smoke.)</i>
<dd>The hidden room in man's house where God sits all the year,
<dd>The secret window whence the world looks small and very dear.
<dd>He sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea
<dd>The crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery;
<dd>They fling great shadows foe-wards, making Cross and Castle dark,
<dd>They veil the plum&egrave;d lions on the galleys of St. Mark;
<dd>And above the ships are palaces of brown, black-bearded chiefs,
<dd>And below the ships are prisons, where with multitudinous griefs,
<dd>Christian captives sick and sunless, all a labouring race repines
<dd>Like a race in sunken cities, like a nation in the mines.
<dd>They are lost like slaves that sweat, and in the skies of morning hung
<dd>The stair-ways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young.
<dd>They are countless, voiceless, hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on
<dd>Before the high Kings' horses in the granite of Babylon.
<dd>And many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell
<dd>Where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell,
<dd>And he finds his God forgotten, and he seeks no more a sign--
<dd><i>(But Don John of Austria has burst the battle-line!)</i>
<dd>Don John pounding from the slaughter-painted poop,
<dd>Purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate's sloop,
<dd>Scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds,
<dd>Breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds,
<dd>Thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea
<dd>White for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty.
<p>
<dd><i>Vivat Hispania!
<dd>Domino Gloria!</i>
<dd>Don John of Austria
<dd>Has set his people free!
<p>
<dd>Cervantes on his galley sets the sword back in the sheath
<dd><i>(Don John of Austria rides homeward with a wreath.)</i>
<dd>And he sees across a weary land a straggling road in Spain,
<dd>Up which a lean and foolish knight for ever rides in vain,
<dd>And he smiles, but not as Sultans smile, and settles back the blade....
<dd><i>(But Don John of Austria rides home from the Crusade.)</i>
<p>
<h2>A Prayer in Darkness</h2>
<p>
<dd>This much, O heaven--if I should brood or rave,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity me not; but let the world be fed,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, in my madness if I strike me dead,
<dd>Heed you the grass that grows upon my grave.
<p>
<dd>If I dare snarl between this sun and sod,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whimper and clamour, give me grace to own,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;In sun and rain and fruit in season shown,
<dd>The shining silence of the scorn of God.
<p>
<dd>Thank God the stars are set beyond my power,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I must travail in a night of wrath,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God my tears will never vex a moth,
<dd>Nor any curse of mine cut down a flower.
<p>
<dd>Men say the sun was darkened: yet I had
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought it beat brightly, even on--Calvary:
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;And He that hung upon the Torturing Tree
<dd>Heard all the crickets singing, and was glad.
<p>
<h2>The Donkey</h2>
<p>
<dd>"The tattered outlaw of the earth,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient crooked will;
<dd>Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep my secret still.
<p>
<dd>"Fools! For I also had my hour;
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;One far fierce hour and sweet:
<dd>There was a shout about my ears,
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;And palms before my feet."
</dl>
