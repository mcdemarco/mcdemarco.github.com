<h2>Intuitionistic Semantics for Hereditarily Harrop Logic
Programming</h2> 

<p>My dissertation is available in several forms.  The <a
href="stretchspace.dvi">dvi file</a> is about 80 pages long - likewise
for the <a href="stretchspace.ps">postscript</a> version.</p>

<p>The text is also available in <a href="stretchbk.ps">postscript
booklet</a> form.  I am not responsible for its behavior on foreign
printers.  It makes several small booklets, not one big one, so staple
accordingly.</p>

<p>Page numbering varies by edition and the official double-spaced
version is not included here, so trust no numbers.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Since the introduction of logic programming in the hereditarily Harrop
fragment of logic by Dale Miller et al., various semantic
interpretations have been suggested, but they have been wanting in
several respects: often the semantics have consisted of single term
models unrelated to standard models for the full logic of which the
language under consideration is a fragment; also, no one [see correction]
has addressed the entire hereditarily Harrop fragment,
either in the first-order or
higher-order case.  Thus no sematics is extant for lambdaProlog,
the higher-order hereditarily Harrop logic programming language.</p>

<p>This dissertation includes an operational model for the first-order
hereditarily Harrop fragment in the style of Miller, using Gopalan
Nadathur's indexed-variable resolution method.  A corresponding Kripke
model is defined, and Miller's indexed model approach is thereby
anchored firmly in the conventional semantics of constructive logic.
This correspondence also yields a semantic proof of uniformity.</p>

<p>The remainder of the dissertation addresses the higher-order
hereditarily Harrop fragment of constructive logic.  On one front,
Dana Scott's Omega-structures for constructive logic are combined
with applicative structures for the lambda-calculus to supply a
constructive model theory and cut elimination theorem for an
intuitionistic version of Church's theory of types (ICTT).  This
necessary prerequisite to discussing lambdaProlog in the context of
higher-order intuitionistic logic appeared to be absent from the
literature.  On another front, a class of models for &lambda;Prolog
considered not as a logical fragment but as an algebra of programs and
goals is provided.  One of these models is the higher-order version of
the operational model.</p>

<h2>Corrections</h2>

<p>There is another model theory for the first-order hereditarily Harrop
fragment of which I was unaware, in Evgeny Makarov, "Models of
Logic Programs w.r.t. Intuitionistic and Minimal Logics,"
<em>Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information
and Computation, S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, July 28-31, 1998</em>, pages
126-131.</p>

<p>New versions of the models for ICTT and UCTT are forthcoming.</p>
