# It's all Google's fault...

I used to mirror my website to GitHub Pages, but Google really, really doesn't like that.  My website can still be found at <a href="http://mcdemarco.net">my website</a> or in jekyll form in [my fork of Left](https://github.com/mcdemarco/left/tree/website).  Here, instead, are some of my programming and other projects.


## Games

* [CardPen](http://cardpen.mcdemarco.net/), a CodePen-like card generator for board game creators in (im)pure JavaScript (code hosted at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/cardpen) because I like Mercurial)
* The [504 Almanac](http://mcdemarco.net/504almanac/), a board game [experiment](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/504/) using React, at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/504almanac)
* [Magnate Roller](http://mcdemarco.net/games/decktet/magnate/), a virtual set of dice and interactive rules for Magnate using Vue.js, also at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/magnate)
* [Myrmex](/myrmex/), a pure JavaScript solitaire game for the Decktet
* [Cascades](http://mcdemarco.net/games/decktet/cascades), a solitaire game for the Decktet using Mithril.js, at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/cascades)
* [Adaman](/adaman/), my improvements on an existing pure JavaScript solitaire game for the Decktet
* [Kingdom Builder Randomizer](/kingdom-builder-randomizer/), an adopted random setup tool for the board game
* [BGG Sorters](http://mcdemarco.net/games/bgg/) use client-side XSLT to interact with the BoardGameGeek XML API to sort games (no archive; view the source).

## Writing Tools

* [DotGraph](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/dotgraph/), a gamebook grapher I wrote to go with [Scree](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/), my Scrivener template for writing gamebooks
* [Paloma](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/), a Twine 2 gamebook story format I wrote to replace the late, lamented Jonah Twine 1 story format

## App.net

* [Paste](http://paste.mcdemarco.net/), a pastebin-style app formerly for App.net, now for pnut.io
* [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net/), my App.net shopping list app (now for pnut.io), is in a private repository at BitBucket but you can view the source code since it's all client-side and uncompressed
