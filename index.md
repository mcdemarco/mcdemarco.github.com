# It's all Google's fault...

I used to mirror my website to GitHub Pages, but Google really, really doesn't like that.  My website can still be found at <a href="http://mcdemarco.net">my website</a> or in jekyll form in [my fork of Left](https://github.com/mcdemarco/left/tree/website).  Here, instead, are some of my programming and other projects.

## App.net

* [Paste](/paste/), a pastebin-style app for App.net
* [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net/), my shopping list app for App.net, is in a private repository at BitBucket but you can view the source code since it's all client-side and uncompressed
* [Crick Ticker](/crick-ticker/), stream marker management for App.net

## Games

* The [504 Almanac](http://mcdemarco.net/504almanac/), a board game [experiment](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/504/) using React and hosted at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/504almanac)
* [Myrmex](/myrmex/), a JavaScript solitaire game for the Decktet
* [Cascades](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/cascades), another JavaScript solitaire game for the Decktet, also at BitBucket
* [Adaman](/adaman/), my improvements on an existing JavaScript solitaire game for the Decktet
* [Kingdom Builder Randomizer](/kingdom-builder-randomizer/), random setup for a board game

## Other

* [SCMS](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/scms/), also hosted at BitBucket (because I prefer Mercurial to git) is a simple CMS based on [my github fork of Singularity CMS](/singularity-cms/)
* [Family Tree Generator](/family-tree-generator/), fantasy family population
* [Betide](/betide/), a CSS animation based on the COLOURlovers API and [my fork](/color-tide/) of color-tide.
* My collection of [bookmarklets for COLOURlovers](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/colourlets/)
* [Bicolorize](http://mcdemarco.net/bicolorize/), another bookmarklet
* [The New Kitchen Cookbook](/the-new-kitchen-cookbook/), my cookbook, in markdown
