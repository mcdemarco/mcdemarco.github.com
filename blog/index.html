  <p>We drove down to <a href="http://www.balticon.org">Balticon 48</a> this past weekend, where we spotted one (1) meteor during the meteor &ldquo;shower&rdquo; and the long-awaited anthology <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617209457/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1617209457&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mcdema-20&amp;linkId=FYYXFORPYCV46TGT">Trafficking in Magic, Magicking in Traffic</a></em> in the dealers' room.  I got to meet the editors and a few fellow contributors in person for the first time, attend the release party, and sign a pile of books.  (So I know my story, &ldquo;Squirrels for Kali&rdquo;, starts on page 201.)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, there are a few more copies available for you to buy at the affiliate link above, and I&rsquo;ve also updated <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/mcdema-20">my Amazon store</a>.</p>

    <a href="/blog/2014/01/14/family-tree-generator">A Random Family Tree Generator</a>
  </h2>

  <section class="byline">

  </section>

  <p>During NaNoWriMo 2013, I wrote a novel about dwarves, and I also wrote a <a href="/tools/family-tree-generator/lineage.html">Random Family Tree Generator</a> in order to populate several dwarf clans, fast.  I&rsquo;d found a few versions of a generator for random medieval family trees (that is, trees of the descendants of a matriarch/patriarch pair) online, but I needed a bunch of other features, like non-human lifespans and gender ratios, and auto-generation and editing of the trees.  It also helped me quite a bit to display the tree as a tree rather than as the lists the original program had used.</p>

<p>The source code has been on <a href="https://github.com/mcdemarco/family-tree-generator">github</a> all along, and recently I added <a href="https://github.com/mcdemarco/family-tree-generator/blob/master/README.md">more gory details</a> to the README, but I&rsquo;ve saved a few for the blog, too:   I had some trouble getting wide family trees to display without wrapping; at first only Safari would do it right, but eventually Safari also started wrapping them.  They still wrap sometimes despite my hack-around for the issue.  There are still some alignment issues with couples and only children in trees; these come from my tree code source, <a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/experiment/css3-family-tree/2">TheCodePlayer CSS3 Family Tree</a>, and I haven&rsquo;t had the time to try to hack them away.</p>

<p>I added better provisions for infant mortality and death in childbirth, in my attempts to scale back some overproduction of medieval humans.  But your browser will still hang if you try to auto-generate huge human families.  (You can get a few hundred years of dwarves safely, though.)  If it hangs, just kill the process or the browser and start again with smaller ambitions.</p>

<p>My final hacks were to my own code; they centered around allowing all dwarf women to be named Dís.  I used a different dwarf naming scheme that&rsquo;s not included in the demo here; all the demo dwarves have Tolkien-style names, and Tolkien&rsquo;s only female dwarf was named&hellip;Dís.  I also discovered that you have to mark your JavaScript as utf-8 in the script tag to get accent marks (as in Dís) to output properly from your scripts.</p>

  <p>Last post I mentioned that I&rsquo;ve been using Penflip for <a href="https://www.penflip.com/mcdemarco/the-new-kitchen-cookbook">a cookbook</a>.  I&rsquo;ve run into <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mcdemarco/post/16633775">some issues</a>, mainly involving images, but I still find it more convenient for my growing collection of recipes than dealing with <a href="/stream/springs/recipes.html">SpringPad</a>&rsquo;s interface.  I am especially reassured to have my cookbook checked out of git onto my own computer, where I feel it&rsquo;s safe from random UI changes like <a href="https://twitter.com/mcdemarco/status/336947399928983552">the one that drove me off SpringPad</a>.</p>

<p>This is not an endorsement of Penflip, however. I never got any response from their support email address; the project seems to have stalled after the initial flurry of PR.  I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a good open-data solution for making your own online cookbook out there, though there are some nice closed-data apps like <a href="http://basil-app.com/">Basil</a> and <a href="http://www.paprikaapp.com/">Paprika</a> for iOS, <a href="http://www.tastebook.com">TasteBook</a> for the web, and <a href="http://blurb.com/">Blurb</a> for printing an actual book.  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-best-apps-to-manage-your-recipe-collection-1451016805">Lifehackers</a> also recommend <a href="https://onetsp.com">One tsp.</a></p>

<p>If Penflip penflops, it will be relatively easy for me to soldier on&mdash;Penflip uses <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>, and I would, too.  I could even build a recipe-only version with better image integration if I had the time.  But for the moment I&rsquo;ve merely worked around Penflip&rsquo;s issues by retrieving my photos from SpringPad, shrinking them down a bit with ImageMagick, and hosting them here on my own site.  If all goes well, I&rsquo;ll be able to download the PDF from Penflip soon.  But I&rsquo;m not holding my breath by any means&hellip;</p>

  <p>Another year, another NaNo:  this was my tenth <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a>, and my tenth victory.  I took a couple of years off recently, but once I got back on the wagon it actually seemed easier than I recalled it being the other nine times.</p>

<p><img src="/files/pictures/nano2013-winner-square.png" alt="nano 2013 winner" /></p>

<p>I found the NaNoWriMo forums much less distracting this year, perhaps because I&rsquo;ve read it all before.  Another secret to my success was muting most of the people I follow on <a href="http://app.net/">app.net</a>; I&rsquo;m looking forward to turning them all back on again tonight.  I made <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mcdemarco/post/13813635">a Patter room for NaNoWriMo</a>, but that didn&rsquo;t end up with much traffic.</p>

<p>The thing that distracted me the most this year was one of my tools:  not <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, which I upgraded to version 2.0 for this novel, but a fantasy family tree generation I&rsquo;ve been working on all month to populate dwarf clans for the novel.  It wasn&rsquo;t particularly necessary, but it provided hours of fun and procrastination.  The incomplete version is in my github account; once a few more bugs are shaken out I&rsquo;ll put it up here for future NaNoWriMo use.</p>

<p>I tried out a few other cool tools this month, most notably <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mcdemarco/post/14757994">Penflip</a>&mdash;which I started using for <a href="https://www.penflip.com/mcdemarco/the-new-kitchen-cookbook">a cookbook</a> rather than the novel&mdash;and <a href="http://donjon.bin.sh">donjon&rsquo;s generators</a> (especially the world generators).</p>

  <p>My husband got his 23andMe results back the other day, and his account was chock full of possible relatives.
My 23andMe results have not attracted much in the way of near cousins over the years, but one popped up when I went in to look at his results (and mock his unexpected <a href="http://plagueblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/lactose-intolerance-in-europe.html">lactose intolerance</a>&mdash;coincidentally, my new 2nd-to-3rd cousin is also from the same 81% lactose-intolerant region of Italy I pointed out in the link).</p>

<p>While I was looking for our common milk-avoiding relatives in the family tree I&rsquo;d imported into 23andMe way back when, I started updating the tree with some marriages and deaths.  So I wanted to update the original database as well, because 23andMe is proprietary and probably dropped lots of information from the GEDCOM file when I imported it and cetera et cetera.</p>

<p>You may recall my choice of genealogy software, LifeLines, from <a href="/blog/2009/10/24/on-the-perils-of-raw-databases/">&ldquo;On the Perils of Raw Databases&rdquo;</a>, my true tale of moving a LifeLines database from a dying PPC Mac to an Intel Mac.  I&rsquo;m on a new Intel Mac now with a new operating system, and when I tried firing up my local copy of LifeLines, it had new issues.</p>

<p>One issue was ^@&rsquo;s over the &ldquo;UI&rdquo;.  LifeLines doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in Fink anymore, so I built it myself from the source on SourceForge.  This didn&rsquo;t improve the situation.  Fighting a forest of broken links, I found the <a href="https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A0=LINES-L">LifeLines mailing list</a> and the vital advice of <a href="https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1302B&amp;L=LINES-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=10079">compiling LifeLines as 32-bit</a>:</p>

<pre><code>  ./configure CFLAGS="-m32 -O"
  make
  make install
</code></pre>

<p>This solved the ^@-signs, but the resulting LifeLines binary ate all my relatives' surnames.  I joined the LifeLines mailing list seeking advice, and the unexpected answer was to set LANG=en_US before running LifeLines:</p>

<pre><code>  LANG=en_US; llines
</code></pre>

<p>Next up is finding and running some of my old LaTeX LifeLines reports so I can send one to a relative who requested a new copy.</p>
