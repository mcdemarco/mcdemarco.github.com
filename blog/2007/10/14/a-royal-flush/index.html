  <p>Despite the <a href="/node/343">little grey man&rsquo;s predictions</a>, Doris Lessing won the 2007 Nobel Prize in literature.  She missed the call and got the news from reporters lying in wait at her home.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSL1363610220071014?pageNumber=1&amp;sp=true">A Reuters TV crew</a> attempted to interview her:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a recognition of your life&rsquo;s work?&rdquo; I persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. See, you&rsquo;ve said it all for me,&rdquo; the feisty and prolific author responded, turning to head indoors.<!--break--></p>

<p>A radio journalist asked her to appear on air. She snapped back that she would have to think of something suitable to say.</p>

<p>Clearly she was not going to make it easy.</p>

<p>I managed to get her to turn around when she was half-way up the garden path by asking her if prizes meant anything to her as obviously they were not the reason she wrote books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look I have won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one. I&rsquo;m delighted to win them all, okay?&rdquo; she responded testily.</p>

<p>As an afterthought she turned around and mumbled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a royal flush.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>In response to some harsh criticism from Harold Bloom, the
New York Times reprinted <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/13/opinion/13lessing.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">a 1992 essay of hers on political correctness</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A very common way of thinking in literary criticism is not seen as a consequence of Communism, but it is. Every writer has the experience of being told that a novel, a story, is “about” something or other. I wrote a story, “The Fifth Child,” which was at once pigeonholed as being about the Palestinian problem, genetic research, feminism, anti-Semitism and so on.</p>

<p>A journalist from France walked into my living room and before she had even sat down said, “Of course ‘The Fifth Child’ is about AIDS.”</p>

<p>An effective conversation stopper, I assure you. But what is interesting is the habit of mind that has to analyze a literary work like this. If you say, “Had I wanted to write about AIDS or the Palestinian problem I would have written a pamphlet,” you tend to get baffled stares. That a work of the imagination has to be “really” about some problem is, again, an heir of Socialist Realism. To write a story for the sake of storytelling is frivolous, not to say reactionary.</p>

<p>The demand that stories must be “about” something is from Communist thinking and, further back, from religious thinking, with its desire for self-improvement books as simple-minded as the messages on samplers.</p>

<p>The phrase “political correctness” was born as Communism was collapsing. I do not think this was chance. I am not suggesting that the torch of Communism has been handed on to the political correctors. I am suggesting that habits of mind have been absorbed, often without knowing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that I didn&rsquo;t expect the Nobel any more than Doris Lessing did, and that I heard about it from <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/10/doris-lessing-on-political-correctness.html">Fake Steve Jobs</a>, of all places.</p>
