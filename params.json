{"name":"mcdemarco @ github","tagline":"to hack out new code and vacuum new felines...","body":"# It's all Google's fault...\r\n\r\nI used to mirror my website to GitHub Pages, but Google really, really doesn't like that.  My website can still be found at [my website](http://mcdemarco.net) or in jekyll form in my fork of Left.  \r\n\r\nHere, instead, are my bigger GitHub projects:\r\n\r\n* [Crick Ticker](/crick-ticker/), stream marker management for App.net\r\n* [Family Tree Generator](/family-tree-generator/), fantasy family population\r\n* [Kingdom Builder Randomizer](/kingdom-builder-randomizer/), random setup for a board game\r\n* [Paste](/paste/), a pastebin-style app for App.net\r\n* [The New Kitchen Cookbook](/the-new-kitchen-cookbook/), my cookbook, in markdown\r\n\r\nThe code for [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net/), my shopping list app for App.net, is in a private repository, but no one's stopping you from viewing the source (which is much cleaner than any of the JavaScript code above).\r\n\r\n[SCMS](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/scms/) is hosted at BitBucket, because I prefer Mercurial to git.  It's a simple CMS based on [my github fork of Singularity CMS](/singularity-cms/).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
