# About

I used to mirror my website to GitHub Pages, but Google really, really doesn't like that, so I now use GitHub Pages to list my programming and other projects, using the Jekyll version of GitHub pages and a simple list in markdown.  Since I'm not a huge fan of git, many of the links used to be to BitBucket projects in Mercurial.
