# It's all Google's fault...

I used to mirror my website to GitHub Pages, but Google really, really doesn't like that.  My website can still be found at [my website](http://mcdemarco.net) or in jekyll form in my fork of Left.  

Here, instead, are my bigger GitHub projects:

* [Crick Ticker](/crick-ticker/), stream marker management for App.net
* [Family Tree Generator](/family-tree-generator/), fantasy family population
* [Kingdom Builder Randomizer](/kingdom-builder-randomizer/), random setup for a board game
* [Paste](/paste/), a pastebin-style app for App.net
* [The New Kitchen Cookbook](/the-new-kitchen-cookbook/), my cookbook, in markdown

The code for [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net/), my shopping list app for App.net, is in a private repository, but no one's stopping you from viewing the source (which is much cleaner than any of the JavaScript code above).
